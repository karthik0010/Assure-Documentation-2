Reusable steps, or shared test cases, allow you to create a set of steps that can be reused across multiple test cases, saving time and ensuring consistency. This guide will walk you through creating shared steps in AssureQA.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Shared Test Cases

### Step 1: Navigate to the Test Case Page

- Go to the test case page and select the test case from which you want to create reusable steps.

### Step 2: Select Test Steps to Share

- Click on the checkboxes next to the test steps you want to group into a reusable shared step.


### Step 3: Create the Shared Test

- Once you‚Äôve selected the steps, click on the **Group Step** icon located above the list of test steps. This action opens a dialog box where you can configure the shared steps.
