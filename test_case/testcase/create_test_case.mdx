Let's explore the process of creating a test case. You can either record a new test case or manually create one. Follow these steps for a smooth experience!

## 🛠️ Step 1: Navigating to the Test Case Page

To get started, head over to the test case page and click on *"Create"*. You’ll be given two options:
- *Record New Test Case*
- *Blank Test Case*

### 🎥 Recording a Test Case Using the Recorder

1. **Choose Your Option**:  
   If you'd like to record a script using the Recorder, select *"Record New Test Case"*. Prefer manual creation? Go with *"Blank Test Case"*. But let’s focus on recording a test case using the Recorder.
