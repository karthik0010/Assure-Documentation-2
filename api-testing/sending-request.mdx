### Interceptor

Interceptor enables you to capture API traffic, including requests and cookies, from a web browser. After capturing requests or cookies, you can view and work with them. AssureQA offers two interceptors like 
Browser and Proxy to intercept API requests and responses for testing purposes.
Browser-Directly sents request from browser to server.
Proxy- Proxy server acts as an intermediary between the client (like a web browser) and the server. It forwards 
client requests to the server and sends the server's response back to the client. 
User can select either of them for testing.
