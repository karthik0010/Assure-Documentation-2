## Interceptor

AssureQA offers two interceptors like Browser and Proxy to intercept API requests and responses for testing purposes.
Browser-Directly sents request from browser to server.
Proxy- Proxy server acts as an intermediary between the client (like a web browser) and the server. It forwards 
client requests to the server and sends the server's response back to the client. 
User can select either of them for testing.

## üåç Environment and Global Variables

**Global Variables**
Global variables in Assureqa are variables that are accessible across all collections, environments, and requests within your Assureqa workspace. They are useful when you need to reuse values across different requests and collections without needing to define them separately each time. The following steps outline the process for creating and utilizing global variables in the request.

1. Click on environment menu

![api28](/images/api28.png)

2. Click on global variables in Assureqa.
3. Click on '+' near search field

![api37](/images/api37.png)

4. Enter key 
5. Enter value
6. Click on save

![api38](/images/api38.png)

7. To unselect the added key-value, click on green tick button.

![api39](/images/api39.png)

8. To delete the added key-value, click on red bin button.

![api40](/images/api40.png)

9. Go to request, paste the global variable in the url field in the form: {{variablename}}.

10. If the environment is selected, the variable remains in red color. To unselect the environment, click on "environment" dropdown button and select "no environment" from the list.

11. When we unselect environment, the variable color changes to green.

![api41](/images/api41.png)

12. Click on save and then send the request.

**Environment Variables**
Environment variables in Assureqa are used to manage dynamic data and simplify the process of testing APIs across different environments. They allow you to store and reuse values such as URLs, API keys, or tokens across multiple requests, making your testing process more efficient and organized. The following steps outline the process for creating and utilizing environment variables in the request.

1. Click on the Environments in Assureqa that appear upon clicking the enviroment menu.
2. Click on '+' near the environment 

![api29](/images/api29.png)

3. Enter a name (e.g., "Development").
4. Click on create, created environment will be displayed on left hand side.

![api30](/images/api30.png)

5. Click on '+' near search field
6. Enter key 
7. Enter value
8. Click on save

![api31](/images/api31.png)

9. To unselect the added key-value, click on green tick button.

![api32](/images/api32.png)

10. To delete the added key-value, click on red bin button.

![api33](/images/api33.png)

11. Go to request, paste the environment variable in the url field in the form: {{variablename}}.
12. If the environment is not selected, the variable remains in red color. To select environment, click on "no environment" dropdown button and select one from the list.

![api34](/images/api34.png)

![api35](/images/api35.png)
