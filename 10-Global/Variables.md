## 🔄 Using Variables in Test Cases

### Applying Variables Effectively

- **In Test Steps**:
  - Variables can be incorporated directly into test steps to dynamically alter test data or conditions without altering the core test scripts.

- **In Locators and JavaScript**:
  - Utilize variables within locator definitions or embedded JavaScript for dynamic testing capabilities.

### Detailed Examples

1. **In Test Editor**:
   - Access the variable list by clicking the definition field and selecting your variable to automatically populate data.
